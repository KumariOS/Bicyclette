# The Bike Stations on a Map.<br>Live on your iPhone.

Grab a bike. Go for a ride. Park it in a station.  
Bicyclette lets you find the nearest bike, and return it, just as fast as possible.

Bicyclette does exactly one thing: it displays the bike stations on a map, with the number of available bikes and free slots. All you have to do is open the app.
